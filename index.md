# 🌿 Handmade threads for wired minds 

Welcome to Boho Byte Bags — where textiles meet tech, and every stitch tells a story.

We make handmade bohemian-style bags, pouches, and accessories with enough soul to carry your tools, trinkets, or terminal.

Whether you're heading to a farmer's market, a hacker conference, or just spinning yarns with friends, we've got a bag that fits your vibe.

## ✂️ Why Boho Byte?

Because you deserve:
- Gear that’s functional *and* expressive
- Bags that outlast trends
- Design with soul and circuitry

## 📦 What's Coming

Soon, you'll find:
- A catalog of one-of-a-kind bags
- Maker notes and sewing hacks
- Behind-the-scenes on fabric, thread, and thought

Stay tuned. The thread is already pulling.

## 📬 Want to stay in the loop?

We're working on a newsletter and maybe a little code to go with your cloth. For now, watch this space.
