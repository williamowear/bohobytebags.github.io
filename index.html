    <p>Boho Byte Bags started in a quiet corner of my rural farmhouse. At the time, I was working from home as a technical writer for a big company, but what really bothered me were the backpacks we all carried to our twice-yearly company meetings.</p>

<p>They were "one-size-fits-all," drab and lifeless, with standard pockets that didn't fit anything. None of them worked really well, and none of them were very stylish.  I knew this from experience, because over the years I had collected a 10x10 storage locker full of them!

    <p>One day, while trying to pack my bag for another overseas trip, I finally had enough. A sewist for many years, I set up my machine, grabbed the only colorful material I had around -- some boho scraps -- and started building a custom bag that looked great and fit my stuff like a glove.</p>

<p>When I got to the meeting, my team couldn't stop talking about my bag, how great it looked, and how everything had a pocket that was just right! Oh, there were still flaws, but that didn't stop everyone I met from asking where I got the bag.</p>

<p>By the time I got home the next week, I had seventeen orders, twelve of them paid in advance at $100 a bag! I hadn't even set a price: one person standing around at break-time offered me that much to make one for them, and as others heard about it, the requests poured in, many with little scribbled requests stapled to money.</p>

<p>Even though I knew from experience that the average hourly wage for custom sewing isn't great, how could I say no? From there, things just took off on their own, and soon, I had no choice but to leave my writing job and start sewing full-time. I've never regretted that decision.</p>
