    <p>Boho Byte Bags started in a quiet corner of my farmhouse bedroom. At the time, I was working from home as a technical writer for a big company, but what really bothered me were the backpacks we all carried to our twice-yearly company meetings.</p>
<p>They were "one-size-fits-all," drab and lifeless, with standard pockets that didn't fit anything well. None of them worked really well, and none of them were very stylish.  I knew this from experience, because over the years I had collected a 10x10 storage locker full of them.
    <p>The city can be divided in two parts, the old town and the modern city. The old town is situated next to the old harbour and is the matrix around which the whole urban area was developed.</p>
    <p>Chania lies along the north west coast of the island Crete.</p>
