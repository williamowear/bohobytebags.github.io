    <p>Boho Byte Bags is getting started in a quiet corner of my rural farmhouse. I'm currently working from home as a technical writer for a big company, but what really bothers me are the backpacks we all carry to our twice-yearly company meetings.</p>

<p>They're "one-size-fits-all," drab and lifeless, with standard pockets that don't exatly fit anything -- which is a shame, since most electronics match one of just a few standard form factors.  None of them work really well, and none of them are very stylish.  I know this from experience, because over the years I have collected a 10x10 storage locker full of them!</p>

<p>So I've decided to rekindle my old sewing hobby.  Since I have lots of Boho material, and Boho is a comfortable niche for bag, I'm going to try putting one together.  First, for me, and later, for others, if they show interest.</p>

<p>Keep watching this space!</p>
